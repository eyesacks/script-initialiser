# script-initialiser
A program to reduce every word in a text file to its first letter. It is meant to create copies of theatrical scripts that contain only the first letter of each word. This is a technique that is sometimes employed by actors to memorise lines. The program should leave most punctuation, and new lines intact. Spaces will be removed, and all remaining letters will be uppercase.
# Compilation
A simple `g++ main.cpp` should suffice.
